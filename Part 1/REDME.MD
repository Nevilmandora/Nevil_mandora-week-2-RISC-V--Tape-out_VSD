# Part 1: BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling


## What is SoC? 

* A system on a chip is an integrated circuit that compresses all of a system’s required components onto one piece of silicon. By eliminating the need for separate and large system components, SoCs help simplify circuit board design, resulting in improved power and speed without compromising system functionality. 


* In other words, the CPU, internal memory, I/O ports, analog processor, as well as additional application-specific circuit blocks, are all designed to be integrated on the same chip. SoCs differentiate themselves from traditional devices and PC architectures, where a separate chip is used for the CPU, GPU, RAM, and other essential functional components.


## Components of SoC:

Components contained within an SoC can be:

* Data processing units

* Embedded memory

* Graphics processing units (GPUs)

* External  interfaces

* Video and audio processing

* Digital Signal Processor


## System on a Chip Applications:

SoCs can be used in a variety of applications, from children’s toys and doorbell cameras to industrial engines. Some SoC uses include:

* Mobile devices

* Automotive systems

* Internet of Things (IoT)

* Consumer electronics

* Industrial applications


## SoC Design: Pros and Cons:

### Pros:

* Space optimization

* Power efficiency

* Cheaper

* Reliability 

* Performance

### Cons:

 * Single point of failure

* Time to market

* Mixed analog/digital

* Flexibility

## Why BabySoC is a simplified model for learning SoC (System-on-Chip) Concepts?

* BabySoC is a simplified model of a System-on-Chip designed for learning. It removes industrial-level complexity but retains the essential components like CPU, memory, bus, and basic peripherals. Its modular, resource-friendly, and educational nature makes it ideal for students to understand SoC concepts such as processor–memory communication, peripheral interfacing, and hardware–software interaction in a clear and practical way.


## What is the role of functional modelling before RTL and physical design stages in this cases?

* Functional modeling is done before RTL and physical design to check the correctness of the SoC at a higher level. It helps in validating the system’s behavior early, finding errors quickly, and exploring different design options. This model acts as a golden reference for RTL verification, ensuring the architecture is correct before moving to costly physical design stages. In short, it reduces design risks, saves time, and makes the overall SoC development process more reliable and efficient.


## Summary:

* So this way the learning of BabySoC model of SoC is helps us in understanding the concepts of SoC, and for learning larger and complex SoC , it is very helpful for us.
